#summary Meeting notes from 1/25/08

= Notes =

 * Question about the word "offer".
 * Have to put something in both fields during reciprocal exchange for it to submit.  Should allow the user to submit without any value in the offer form.
 * "Don't offer" remembers what you had in the last round but doesn't preform an incorrect calculation.
 * Practice rounds might need to be a new experiment type.  Decided that practice types can just be regular explanations.
 * Forms should have some percentage of completion.
 * Add a note to the experiment page asking users to answer questions.

 * "Insufficient X" is a poor message, and should not adjust the value.
 * Two buttons are grayed out; Coye made an offer, viewed the offer, counter offered, "Round" and "Counter" are grayed out

= Questions =
 * Is there an preference where you can set the starting value of the bank?
