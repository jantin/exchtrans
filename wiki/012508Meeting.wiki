#summary Meeting notes from 1/25/08

= Notes =

 * Question about the word "offer".
 * Have to put something in both fields during reciprocal exchange for it to submit.  Should allow the user to submit without any value in the offer form.
 * "Don't offer" remembers what you had in the last round but doesn't preform an incorrect calculation.
 * Practice rounds might need to be a new experiment type.  Decided that practice types can just be regular explanations.
 * Forms should have some percentage of completion.
 * Add a note to the experiment page asking users to answer questions.

 * "Insufficient X" is a poor message, and should not adjust the value.
 * Two buttons are grayed out; Coye made an offer, viewed the offer, counter offered, "Round" and "Counter" are grayed out.

 * Never force someone to have to exchange.
 * Tell the user how many points they will have if they cheat

= Judd's Notes =

 * in later version, static text pages should allow for inclusion of variables, for example the player name assigned to you
 * In reciprocal exchange, if you try to enter more than the maximum X or Y allowed to give in a single round, it should revert to blank instead of defaulting to the maximum. (e.g. if you put in 99Xs, it shows an error message and auto. switches the value to 50Xs)
 * bug: displays old offer from last trial, even though the calculated points are correct
 * Practice trials? Naming convention: PRAC - 
 * Include practice questionnaire as well.
 * Can we put text at the top of the questionnaire?
 * Can we put a practice round in between two real rounds in which we'd like to carry over the bank?
 * Instead of 'insufficent X', 'You don't have enough X.'
 * state issue: Coye made an offer, I viewed it, counter and end round are greyed out, accept is only option.
 * in experimenter view, last element of the experiment did not flip its status to 'Done.', even though the experiment completed.


= Questions =
 * Is there an preference where you can set the starting value of the bank?
