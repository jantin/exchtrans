# Nate's Issues #

General:
  * Update the server to a newer version of Django.
  * Javascript should be refactored.
  * Having some sort of test server would be grand.
  * Having some sort of testing suite for the javascript / ui would be grander (like selenium).

  * [Issue #25](https://code.google.com/p/exchtrans/issues/detail?id=#25) - Nex rewording.
  * [Issue #28](https://code.google.com/p/exchtrans/issues/detail?id=#28) - Buttons grayed out incorrectly.  I couldn't replicate this, the only thing I can think of is that newer versions of the django framework somehow eliminate this bug, but I doubt it.
  * [Issue #35](https://code.google.com/p/exchtrans/issues/detail?id=#35) - Major issue with how the popup window is created, there is no perception of the state of the interface in the current JS, so there is no way to say "Wait, a popup is currently open and I can't show this new popup until it's closed."

Other thoughts:
  * Different tests
  * Need Java code from Coye
